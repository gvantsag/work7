                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Nature!</h2>
                <p>
                    Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe. <span style="color: red;">"Nature"</span> can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.

                <ol>
                    The word nature is derived from the Latin word natura, or <span style="color: red;">"essential qualities, innate disposition"</span>,
                     and in ancient times, literally meant <span style="color: red;">"birth"</span>. In ancient philosophy, Natura is mostly used as the 
                     Latin translation of the Greek word physis, which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics 
                     that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord. The concept of nature 
                     as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with 
                     certain core applications of the word by pre-Socratic philosophers <span style="color:blue">(though this word had a dynamic 
                     dimension then, especially for Heraclitus)</span>, and has steadily gained currency ever since. During the 
                     advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, 
                     organized and moved by divine laws. With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became 
                     seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention : it was hence considered as sacred 
                     by some traditions or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history <span style="color: blue">(Hegel, Marx)</span>. 
                     However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the presocratic one, got reborn at the same time, 
                     especially after Charles Darwin.
